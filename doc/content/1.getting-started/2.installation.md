### 1. Backend Setup

```bash [Terminal]
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/saasterkit.git
cd saasterkit
composer install
cp .env.txt .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan app:create-admin
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash [Terminal]
npm install
npm run dev
# or if you want ssr
npm run build:ssr
php artisan inertia:start-ssr
```

::note
**Note:**

- SSR won't work out of the box because the nuxt ui plugin. you will need to manually fix your `botstrap/ssr.js` or nuxt ui package itself. You have to change `payload: { serverRendered: false }` by `payload: { serverRendered: typeof window === "undefined" }`,

### 3. External Services (.env)

- **Stripe:** Populate `STRIPE_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET`, and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Create corresponding Price IDs in your Stripe account and add them to the `.env` file (`STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_MONTH`, etc.).
- **Socialite:** Add your credentials for Google and GitHub. In local environment, you can use `ngrok` to have a public url of your project to test the socialite connection.
- **Socialite and Stripe:** In local environment, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to have a public url which is needed to use them.

::note
**Configuration Notes:**

- **Stripe:** In your Stripe dashboard, enable the customer portal. It's also highly recommended to configure Stripe to allow only one active subscription per customer (team) to match the design of this starter kit.
- **Plans:** Ensure the Stripe Price IDs in your `.env` file match the plans defined in `app/Enums/Billing/PlanEnum.php`.
