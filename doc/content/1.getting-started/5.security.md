### Trusted proxies

For development purpose, all proxies are trusted in bootsrap.php and you should change this or remove it in production

```php[bootstrap/app.php]
    $middleware->trustProxies(
        at: '*',
        headers: Request::HEADER_X_FORWARDED_FOR |
        Request::HEADER_X_FORWARDED_HOST |
        Request::HEADER_X_FORWARDED_PORT |
        Request::HEADER_X_FORWARDED_PROTO
    );
```
