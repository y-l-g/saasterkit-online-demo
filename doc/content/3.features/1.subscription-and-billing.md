The **Team** is the billable entity, managed via `Laravel\Cashier`.

### Defining Plans

The single source of truth for subscription plans is `App\Enums\Billing\PlanEnum.php`. This enum maps plan names to features and Stripe Price IDs.

```php [app/Enums/Billing/PlanEnum.php]
enum PlanEnum: string
{
    case PRO = 'pro';

    public function prices(): array
    {
        return [
            'month' => env('STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_MONTH'),
            'year' => env('STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_YEAR'),
        ];
    }
    //...
}
```
A mirrored, presentation-only configuration exists in `resources/js/config/plans.ts` for use on public marketing pages.

### Admin Subscription Management

The `/admin/subscriptions` dashboard uses `spatie/laravel-query-builder` to enable server-side filtering and sorting of subscriptions directly from URL query parameters. The filtering logic is encapsulated in query scopes on the `Subscription` model.
