The **Team** is the billable entity, managed via `Laravel\Cashier`.

### Defining Plans

The single source of truth for subscription plans is `App\Enums\Billing\PlanEnum.php`. This enum maps plan names to features and Stripe Price IDs.

A mirrored, presentation-only configuration exists in `resources/js/config/plans.ts` for use on public marketing pages.

Subscription are managed in Stripe Checkout and Stripe Billing Portal. You may configure the checkout in `app/Http/Controllers/Billing/CreateStripeCheckoutController.php`.

### Configuring Stripe

This starter kit is designed for only one subscription per team (the default subscription), you should configure stripe to allow only one subscription per customer.
