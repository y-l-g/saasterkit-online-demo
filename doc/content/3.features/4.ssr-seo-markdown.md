### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

The application is pre-configured for SSR. The most relevant customization is the use of **Unhead** (`@unhead/vue`) for robust head management (titles, meta tags), which is integrated in `resources/js/ssr.ts`.

### Static Pages from Markdown

You can easily create content-heavy pages like a Privacy Policy from Markdown files.

1. Place a Markdown file in `resources/markdown/`.
2. Create a controller to read the file, convert it to HTML, and pass it to a generic `public/Markdown` Inertia view.
3. Add the corresponding route in `web.php`.

```php [app/Http/Controllers/Public/PrivacyController.php]
class PrivacyController extends Controller
{
    public function __invoke(MarkdownRenderer $markdownRenderer): Response
    {
        $htmlContent = $markdownRenderer->toHtml(
            File::get(resource_path('markdown/privacy.md'))
        );

        return Inertia::render('public/Markdown', [
            'content' => $htmlContent,
        ]);
    }
}
