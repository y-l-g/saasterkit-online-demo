### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

The application is pre-configured for SSR. The most relevant customization is the use of **Unhead** (`@unhead/vue`) for robust head management (titles, meta tags), which is integrated in `resources/js/ssr.ts`. The app has it's own composable `usPageSeo()`. It's a wrapper arround useHead(). The starter kit provides also a middleware to disable ssr on certain routes where it is not suited. SSR should be allowed only on public facing pages.

```php [routes/web.php]
Route::get('dashboard', AppDashboardShowController::class)->middleware('nossr')->name('dashboard');
```

### Known issue with SSR and nuxt ui

You may have an issue with the ssr build botstrap/ssr.js because of nuxt ui trying to access `document` which is not defined in ssr context.

### Icons in SSR mode

Icons are not rendered in ssr and to avoid waiting them when you open the page use [unplugin-icons](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-icons) to resolve icons during the build

```vue
import ILucideUser from '~icons/lucide/user'
<template>
    <UIcon name="ILucideUser" />
</template>
```

instead of

```vue
<template>
    <UIcon name="i-lucide-user" />
</template>
```

### Static Pages from Markdown

You can easily create content-heavy pages like a Privacy Policy from Markdown files.

```php [app/Http/Controllers/Public/PrivacyController.php]
class PrivacyController extends Controller
{
    public function __invoke(MarkdownRenderer $markdownRenderer): Response
    {
        $htmlContent = $markdownRenderer->toHtml(
            File::get(resource_path('markdown/privacy.md'))
        );

        return Inertia::render('public/Privacy', [
            'content' => $htmlContent,
        ]);
    }
}
```
