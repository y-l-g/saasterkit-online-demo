### Plans and Features

Plans and their associated features are defined as enums for type-safety and clarity.

- **Plans:** `App\Enums\Teams\PlanEnum` (e.g., `PRO`, `PREMIUM`).
- **Permissions:** `App\Enums\Teams\FeatureEnum` (e.g., `pro_feature`).

The features for each plan are defined within the `PlanEnum` file. You can add new plans or modify features there.

```php [app/Enums/Teams/PlanEnum.php]
    public function features(): array
    {
        return match ($this) {
            self::PRO => [
                FeatureEnum::PRO_FEATURE_1,
            ],
            self::PREMIUM => [
                FeatureEnum::PRO_FEATURE_1,
                FeatureEnum::PREMIUM_FEATURE_1,

            ],
        };
    }
```

### Frontend composable

This starter kit provides a convenient composable to check the features of a user based on his current team.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { hasFeature } = useFeatures();
</script>
<template>
    <AudioPlayer v-if="hasFeature('audio')" :team="team" :member="member" />
</template>
```
