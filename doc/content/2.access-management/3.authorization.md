### Super Admin

A user with the `is_admin` flag set to `true` bypasses all permission checks across the entire application via a `Gate::before` callback in `AuthServiceProvider`.

### Usage in Controllers

In controllers, authorization is best handled via Form Requests.

```php [app/Http/Requests/Teams/TeamUpdateRequest.php]
public function authorize(): bool
{
    /** @var Team $team */
    $team = $this->route('team');

    return Gate::allows(TeamMemberPermissionEnum::TEAM_UPDATE, $team);
}
```
